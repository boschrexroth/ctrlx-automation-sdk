# README Node.js datalayer.provider

This Node.js sample provides some registered nodes to the ctrlX Data Layer tree. 

__IMPORTANT__:

The sample creates and registers all nodes individually, which is recommended for _small_ to _medium_ sized set of nodes to handle. If you're dealing with a _large_ set of nodes (big data provider) or any _dynamic node hierarchy_, we recommend to use a _virtual provider_ approach, listening just to any _wildcarded address_ ( e.g. myRoot/**) and using _self-managed virtual nodes_, just returned in _OnBrowse()_ method, which is more efficient.

Please read the _Best Practise_ section in common Node.js documentation for more details and recommended samples.

## Introduction

The sample demonstrates how to provide nodes to ctrlX Data Layer tree. 
The provider creates nodes with types of int/double/string. 
Also a complex type encoded by [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) is provided.

## Description

The sample demonstrates 

+ How to provide nodes with different data types to __ctrlX Data Layer__

+ How to create and provide meta data to nodes

+ How to provide nodes with read-only or read-write support
  
+ How to register a user defined flatbuffers type

## Prerequisites

Please read the common Node.js docs [here](./../README.md), first.

## Compile Flatbuffers Schema

This app uses a flatbuffer defined in the schema file sampleSchema.fbs. From this schema file we have to create a binary file which is registered on the ctrlX and a Node.js class to create and access the defined flatbuffer data. These tasks can be done with the command line tool flatc.

This tool is provided by this SDK under /bin/oss.flatbuffers/..insert OS version here../release/

Do following steps

* Create a binary flatbuffers file with Visual Studio Code tasks:

   - "flatc binary (x64)"
   - "flatc binary (arm64)"

   The generated file is stored in src/sampleSchema.bfbs

* Generate the Node.js class with Visual Studio Code tasks:

    - "flatc class (x64)"
    - "flatc class (arm64)"

   The generated code is stored in src/sampleSchema_generated.js
   
## Debug and Run
1. Run 'npm install' in the terminal.  
2. Launch the app with the debugger attached by pressing __F5__.

## Build and Install

1. Launch Visual Studio Code
2. Click on the __Remote Explorer__ from the menu.
3. Choose __Open Folder in QEMU VM__.
4. Open the directory __datalayer.provider__.
5. Build and install snap as described [here](./../README.md).
6. Checkout ctrlX Data Layer web frontend (Settings | Data Layer) 
7. Check the output using __Diagnostics__:

   - Login into your ctrlX
   - Navigate to __Diagnostics -> Logbook__
   - Click __Settings__ on the right top corner
   - Enable __Show system messages__
   - Navigate to __Filter -> Units__ and check your __snap.sdk-node-provider-simple.app.service__
   - Now you should the see the app output diagnostics.
   - Press __Refresh__ to update.

8. If you have root permissions, you can also watch the output on any ssh console with the command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo snap logs sdk-node-provider-simple.app -f | more
   ```
