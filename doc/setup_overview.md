To develop ctrlX CORE applications with the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK we need a so called __App Build Environment__ which is a Ubuntu 20.04 Linux operating system with a special set of software packages installed and certain settings.

* The chapter [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.md) provides the fastest way to create an app with one of the SDKs sample projects.

* In [ctrlX WORKS App Build Environment](setup_qemu_ctrlx_works.md) the __recommended way__ creating and running an App Build Environment is described.

* [Important Installation Scripts](install-scripts.md) gives an overview of scripts needed to install programming language dependent tools.

* If ctrlX WORKS cannot be used the chapter [QEMU Virtual Machine](setup_qemu_ubuntu.md) shows how QEMU can be installed as standalone app and how a QEMU VM can be setup as App Build Environment.

* [VirtualBox Virtual Machine](setup_windows_virtualbox_ubuntu.md) describes how to setup such a VM to use it as App Build Environment.

* [Native Ubuntu 20.04](setup_ubuntu.md) shows how to setup a bare-metal machine to use it as App Build Environment.

* [Install Sources from github](install-sources-from-github.md) describes how to download and install the github repository __ctrlX AUTOMATION Software Development Kit__ [https://github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk](https://github.com/boschrexroth/ctrlx-automation-sdk)
