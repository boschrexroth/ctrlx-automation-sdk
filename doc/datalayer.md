## Node names

Each value is addressed by a path. A path creates of a set of nodes. When nodes are
named, an API is intuitive and easy to use. If done poorly, that same API can
feel difficult to use and to understand.

A **node can be a singleton or a collection**. For Example ```customers``` is a
collection node and ```customer``` is a singleton resource (in a banking
domain). We can identify ```customers``` collection resource using the path
```/customers```. We can identify a single ```customer``` resource using
the path ```/customers/{customerID}```.

A **node may contain sub-collection resources** also. For example, sub-collection
resource ```accounts``` of a particular ```customer``` can be identified
using the path ```/customers/{customerId}/accounts``` (in a banking domain).
Similarly, a singleton resource ```account``` inside the sub-collection
resource ```accounts``` can be identified as
follows:  ```/customers/{customerId}/accounts/{accountId}```.

## Provider <a name="provider"></a>

A provider is responsible for nodes. One provider can handle an unlimited amount
of nodes. All requests to one provider are serialized: It's guarantied that if
you are in one of the interface functions of a node (onRead, onWrite, ...) no
other interface function of a node handled by the same provider is called. So
you don't have to handle mutual exclusion to data handled by one provider.

### Register of nodes

To register a path you have to specify which ProviderNode is responsible for this node.

Example:
Registration for ethercat/version: whenever a request for "ethercat/version" is send, this request will be routed to this particular node.

If a provider is responsible for multiple nodes or the subnodes are unknown at the moment of registration, its possible to register with wildcards.

### Single wildcard "\*"

A single wildcard is the sign "\*". "\*" stands for a any string on a hierarchy level. You can use multiple wildcards at different levels.

Examples:

* provider1: test/\*
* provider2: test/foo/\*/bar
* provider3: test/\*/foo
* provider4: test/\*/\*
* provider5: test/bar/bar

### Double wildcard "\*\*"

A double wildcard is the string "\*\*". "\*\*" stands for any string on any hierarchy level. Such a wildcard is only allowed as last characters at your registration string.

Example:

* provider6: test/\**
* provider7: test/bar/**

## Routing of requests <a name="Routing"></a>

All requests except browse requests are routed to the provider the address matches best to the registered path.
So on each level a registration with a specific path matches before a registration with a wildcard.
A single wildcard matches before a double wildcard.
An address matches always the best registered provider (see example).
Only provider with a wildcard at end of it's registered address will get browse requests.

### Behavior of '/'

Any '/' at begin or end at the request address will be removed. A provider will
never get an address with a leading or tailing '/'. Routing of addresses will be
done without a leading or tailing '/'.

### Example for routing of requests:

| address              | destination for browse | destination for read |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| ""                   | nobody                 | nobody               |
| "test"               | provider1              | nobody               |
| "test/1"             | provider4              | provider1            |
| "test/1/foo"         | provider6              | provider3            |
| "test/1/bar"         | provider6              | provider4            |
| "test/foo"           | provider4              | provider1            |
| "test/bar"           | provider7              | provider1            |
| "test/bar/bar"       | provider7              | provider5            |
| "test/bar/foo"       | provider7              | provider7            |
| "test/bar/bar/foo"   | provider7              | provider7            |
| "test/bar/foo/foo"   | provider7              | provider7            |
| "test/foo/foo"       | provider6              | provider3            |
| "test/foo/foo/bar"   | provider6              | provider2            |
| "test/foo/foo/foo"   | provider6              | provider6            |
| "test/1/bar"         | provider6              | provider4            |
| "test/1/bar/1"       | provider6              | provider6            |

### Browse

Whenever a node is browsed, the result is a list of strings with contains the names of the subnodes of this nodes. In general datalayer wants to answer this kind of requests at its own. Only if someone has registered with a wildcard ("*") for this particular node this provider will be asked to give for subnodes. The result of this request will be merged with the nodes datalayer knows for its own. So a provider does not need to return values on a browse request it has already registered with a more specific path.

| address              | result of browse                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ""                   | "test"                               |
| "test"               | "foo", "bar" + return from provider1 |
| "test/1"             | "foo" + return from provider4        |
| "test/1/foo"         | return from provider6                |
| "test/1/bar"         | return from provider6                |
| "test/foo"           | "foo" + return from provider4        |
| "test/bar"           | "foo" + "bar"+ return from provider7 |
| "test/bar/bar"       | return from provider7                |
| "test/bar/foo"       | return from provider7                |
| "test/bar/bar/foo"   | return from provider7                |
| "test/bar/foo/foo"   | return from provider7                |
| "test/foo/foo"       | "bar" + return from provider6        |
| "test/foo/foo/bar"   | return from provider6                |
| "test/foo/foo/foo"   | return from provider6                |
| "test/1/bar"         | return from provider6                |
| "test/1/bar/1"       | return from provider6                |

## Provider Interface functions <a name="providerInterface"></a>

Properties:

* idempotent, i.e. operation will have the same effect on the servers state if
  executed once or multiple times (note: this does not necessarily mean returning
  the same response or status code)
* safe, i.e. must not have side effects such as state changes
* Input data
* Output data

| function   | description              | safe | idempotent | Input | Output |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | :--: | :--------: | :---: | :-----: |
| onCreate   | Creates an object        | no   | no         | yes   | yes    |
| onRemove   | Removes an object        | no   | yes        | no    | no     |
| onBrowse   | Browse childs of a node  | yes  | yes        | no    | yes    |
| onRead     | Reads value of a node    | yes  | yes        | yes   | yes    |
| onWrite    | Writes value to a node   | no   | yes        | yes   | yes    |
| onMetadata | Reads metadata of a node | yes  | yes        | no    | no     |

Requests are Stateless: Your node/application is not allowed to store anything
about latest request. Handle each and every request as new. No session, no
history. Design your interface in a way that each request contains all the
information necessary to service the request.

``` Text
No Client context shall be stored on the server between requests.
The client is responsible for managing the state of the application.
```

### onCreate

This function should be used to create a new object. This function is not
idempotent. So two calls of onCreate will not have the same result. As input
all data should be provided to create the object. As output data the location
(path) of of the new object should be returned.

Examples:

* Creating an order in an online shop
* Creating an axis
* Creating a Motion Command

### onRemove

This function removes an object. No input and output data are allowed.

Examples:

* Removing an axis

### onBrowse

This function returns child nodes of this node. The result must be an
array of strings with the names of the child nodes.

### onRead

This function reads the value of a node. To specify the read operation the onRead
function may have input data. This function is idempotent and safe. So two equal
subsequent calls will have the same result and will not change the state.

### onWrite

This function changes the value of an already existing node. The new value is
provided as input data. As output data you can return the new node value or
nothing. This function is idempotent. So if you send a request multiple
times, that should be equivalent to a single request modification.

### onMetadata

This function returns the metadata of this note. You have to return a
metadata.fbs flatbuffer. See [metadata](#metadata).

## Usage of Variant <a name="variant"></a>

A variant holds data of different types. Following basic types are defined:

| type              | description                                          |

### Set a value of a variant

To set a value to a variant, you can use one of the following functions:

* setValue(\<type\> value)
  * value is a C data type: type of the variant will be identified **automatically** by its type (including string)
  * value is a vector/set:
    * array type of the variant will be identified **automatically**
    * values will be copied
* setValue(\<type\>\* values, size_t count)
  * value is array of c data type (including array of string)
  * array type of variant will be identified **automatically** by its type (including string)
  * values will be copied
* shareValue(\<type\>\* values, size_t count)  
  * In some cases it is not necessary to copy the value to a variant. A reference to the particular data is sufficient.
  * type of variant will be identified automatically
  * only a pointer to data will be stored
  * this function is faster than the copy functions
* copyFlatbuffers()
  * copyFlatbuffer from flatbuffer builder object
* shareFlatbuffers
  * same as copyFlatbuffers() but data will not be copied.
  * Only pointer to data will be stored
* setSharedPointer(type, data, size)
  * set a variant to **type** with **data** and **size**
  * data will not be copied, only a pointer will be stored
* setType(type, size) + copyRaw(data, size)
  * set a variant with a specific **type** and **size** with **data**
  * data will be copied
  
### Get a value of a variant

To access data you can assign a variant to a basic data type. If the type of the variant match the basic data type,
the value will be copied to the variable. If the type did not match, 0 or NULL will be returned.

#### Example access scalar values

``` Text
 Variant variant;
 uint32_t value1 = 4711;
 variant.setValue(value1);
 uint32_t value2 = variant; // value2 is 4711
 uint16_t value3 = variant; // value3 is 0
```

To get the type of a variant use **getType()**

#### Accessing values of an Array

You can assign a variant to an C array type. If the type of the variant match the basic data type.

#### Example access array values

``` Text
 Variant data; // data containing an array of string
 const char** strArray = data;
 for (size_t i = 0; i < data.getCount(); i++)
   printf("%s", strArray[i]);
```

You can also use this kind of access for non-array values. getCount() returns 1 for nonArray values and cast to const pointer returns address of data.
  
#### Access flatbuffers

A variant can hold a flatbuffer. To check whether a variant has a specific flatbuffer type you can use the verifier of the flatbuffer.
This check contains check for right data type (FLATBUFFERS) and check against flatbuffer verifier.

``` Text
  Variant data; // data with a flatbuffer
  if (STATUS_SUCCEEDED(data.verifyFlatbuffers(VerifyAxisBuffer))); // VerifyAxisBuffer is generated out of .fbs file
  {
    auto axis = GetAxis(data->getData()); // GetAxis is generated out of .fbs file
  }
```

## Usage of flatbuffers <a name="flatbuffers"></a>

Flatbuffers is used for complex data types. Documentation is available at [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).

Base of a complex data type is type defined in a [.fbs](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html) file.
Out of a .fbs file you have to generate different files:

![Flatbuffer Compiler](./images/flatbuffer_compiler.png)

* type_generated.h
  * File to include in your source code. This header enables you to access a existing flatbuffer or create a new one.
* type.bfbs
  * binary representation of the type. This file is used for generic access to a flatbuffer. It enables the datalayer to
    convert between flatbuffer and JSON.
  * If you use flatbuffers as a data, you have to return the content of this file as metadata (see [metadata](#metadata))

### Automatic Build using CMake

To build your `.fbs` files using CMake include following lines in your CMakeLists.txt.

To use the right flatbuffer compiler use these lines:

``` CMake
# set flatbuffer root folder
set(FLATBUFFER_ROOT ${DEPENDENCIES_ROOT}/appflatbuffers)

# expand binary search path for flatbuffer compiler
if (WIN32)
  set(CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH ${CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH} ${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/bin/win-msvc-x86/release)
else()
  set(CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH ${CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH} ${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/bin/linux-gcc-x64/release)

  # set executable attributes for flatbuffer compiler
  execute_process(COMMAND chmod +x ${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/bin/linux-gcc-x64/debug/flatc)
  execute_process(COMMAND chmod +x ${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/bin/linux-gcc-x64/release/flatc)
endif()

# include flatbuffer cmake functions
include(${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/CMake/FindFlatBuffers.cmake)
```

To compile your `.fbs` files, use these lines:

``` CMake
set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ${CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH} ${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/include )
include(${FLATBUFFER_ROOT}/public/CMake/FindFlatBuffers.cmake)

SET ( IDL_FILES ${IDL_FILES}
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/mockups/Interpolator.fbs
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/mockups/AllDataTypes.fbs
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/motion/axis.fbs
)

build_flatbuffers( "${IDL_FILES}" "" BuildFlatbuffers "" "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}" "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}" "")
```

This will generate an additional buildtarget `BuildFlatbuffers`. You can add this build target to your dependencies.

### Tips and Tricks

1. Force Defaults / IsField Present
   * Tables fields are only stored if they are set and are different from its default values. To ensure that all values are set in your
     flatbuffer, you can enable force_default in flatbuffer builder object:
     ``` C++
     flatbuffers::FlatBufferBuilder builder;
     builder.ForceDefaults(true);
     ```
2. Access of array values
   * assume .fbs file
     ``` C++
     table myTable {
       myVecDouble:[double];
     }
     root_type MyTable;
     ```
   * access as flatbuffer vector
     ``` C++
     auto myTable = GetMyTable(value.getData());
     auto myVecDouble = myTable->myVecDouble();
     for (size_t i = 0; i < myVecDouble->size(); i++)
       double value = myVecDouble[i];
     ```
   * access as C array
     ``` C++
     auto myTable = GetMyTable(value.getData());
     const double* myVecDouble = myTable->myVecDouble()->data();
     for (size_t i = 0; i < myVecDouble->size(); i++)
       double value = myVecDouble[i];
     ```
   * access as plane uint_8* memory (little endian)
     ``` C++
     auto myTable = GetMyTable(value.getData());
     const uint_8* myVecDouble = myTable->myVecDouble()->Data();
     ```

## Metadata <a name="metadata"></a>

Metadata contains additional information about a node. This information can be
read using the metadata function.
Definition of metadata can be found [here](./fbs/comm/datalayer/metadata.fbs).

| field              | comment |
| ------------------ | --------|
| nodeClass          | Resource: node is a resource <br> Method: node is a command <br> Type: node represents a type |
| operations         | contains allowed operations |
| description        | Short description in markdown format |
| descriptionUrl     | URL to detailed description |
| displayName        | Name to be displayed instead of node address |
| displayFormat      | Auto: display in standard type format <br> Bin: display as binary <br> Oct: display octal <br> Dec: display Decimal <br> Hex: display hexadecimal |
| unit               | unit of value |
| extensions         | user defined extensions (key/value pair) |
| references         | references to other nodes (key/value pair) |

### References to other nodes in metadata <a name="metadataReferences"></a>

Metadata of nodes can reference other nodes. A reference contains of a type and
a targetAddress.
There are some predefined types of references

| type         | comment |
| ------------ | ------- |
| readType     | type when reading a value |
| writeType    | type when writing a value |
| createType   | type when creating a value |

The target of a reference is a address in the datalayer tree.

## Typetree <a name="typetree"></a>

All types are included as nodes in the datalayer tree. Types are located under
"types/". Types can be references in metadata as a reference.

## Usage Of Client <a name="client"></a>

### Creation

To create a client use factory function ```createClient(addr)```.
For ```addr``` you have following possibilities

| connection scheme | comment |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| INPROC            | Use empty address string to use in process communication. This works only if your client is in same address space (process) like datalayer application. |
| IPC               | Only available in Linux. Use this communication kind in same device between processes. |
| TCP               | Communication between devices |

| addr                   | comment |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| ""                     | INPROC communication (default) |
| DL_IPC_AUTO            | Automatic choice of IPC port. It uses \<$HOME\>/.datalayer/frontend/2069 as IPC communication port. You can also use this define for communication between snaps with same user |
| "ipc://\<path\>        | IPC communication with specific path. You have to run a broker with this IPC path. |
| "tcp://\<ip\>:\<port\> | TCP communication with specific device. Standard port of TCP is 2069. |

## Celix Bundle

This components includes a Celix bundle. You can use it in your own Celix
framework. Be careful that on your target exists only one broker. So if you
use datalayer in multiple Celix framework only one broker has to be started. To
control start of broker you can use following entry in config.properties in your
Celix preferences.

``` C++
datalayer.broker.enable=false
```

The default value of this switch is true. So you have to set it explicit to
false to disable startup of broker in your system.
