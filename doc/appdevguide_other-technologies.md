# APPENDIX TO THE CTRLX APP DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

## 1. Document Overview

This document is part of the Bosch Rexroth ctrlX CORE App Development Guidelines, and gives hints for Components and Apps, which are not provided as Linux Ubuntu Core App.
Please make sure that you know the App Development Guidelines, that you can easily understand the content of this document.

The following deployment technologies are considered here

- Windows Application (usually Engineering Tools for ctrlX CORE and ctrlX CORE Apps)
- PLC Libraries, which are used in the ctrlX CORE PLC App based on Codesys
- Node-RED palettes which are loaded into the ctrlX CORE Node-RED App

For each technology this document povides

- A List of aspects which have to be considered in general for onboarding to ctrlX World. Please refer to the App Development Guide for further information on these aspects.
- A brief description of aspects, which are specific to the used deployment technology

The content of this document may be subject of change in further versions of the Validation Process.
