# Use Px as Local Proxy on a Windows Host

This documentation is __for Windows hosts only without direct internet access__.

## Introduction

Host computers without direct internet access are using a proxy server to connect to the internet. __In this case we have to provide the proxy service also for a SDK builder VM running on this host__.

We recommend to install and run __px.exe__ as local proxy server on your Windows host. This local proxy forwards http and https requests to the configured remote proxy.

Here some advantages of px.exe:

* Simple to install and configure
* Same port for http and https forwarding
* No need to store credential informations (user, password) in config file(s) because Px uses the encrypted Windows credentials.
* Preconfigured usage in the ctrlX AUTOMATION SDK QEMU VMs

For more informations about Px see [What is Px](https://github.com/genotrance/px)

## Installation of Px as Local Proxy Server

* Open [https://github.com/genotrance/px/releases/](https://github.com/genotrance/px/releases/)
* Click button Latest
* Click px-v?.?.?-windows.zip (v?.?.? e.g. v0.8.4)
* The zip archive will be downloaded
* Unzip the content e.g. to c:\tools\px
* Create a px-start.bat file in  with the content:

```code
    cd c:\tools\px

    px.exe
```

* Manually call this bat file

Enter this command for further usage of Px:

```code
    px.exe --help
```

For automatically run at startup do following steps:

* Create a link to px-start.bat
* Open the startup folder with Windows logo key + R, enter __shell:startup__
* Move the link to px-start.bat into this folder

!!! important
    Px provides both http and https access via default port __3128__. If this port is not available on the host it can be changed in px.ini BUT: The alternative port has to be changed in the VM too - see [Setup a QEMU VM](setup_qemu_ubuntu.md) and [Setup a Virtual Box VM](setup_windows_virtualbox_ubuntu.md).

## Proxy Settings in the App Build Environment

As mentioned a VM running on a host without direct internet access has to use a proxy server too.

For the VM Px on the host is reachable via the URL __<http://10.0.2.2:3128>__

Note: 10.0.2.2 is the IP address of the host from the perspective of the App Build Environment. See also [QEMU Virtual Machine Networking](setup_qemu_ubuntu.md#qemu-virtual-machine-networking)

For your information only - do not change if not necessary:

This URL is stored as so called "Proxy Settings" in the VM e.g. in following files:

* /etc/environment *1)
* /etc/wgetrc
* ~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config

*1) Here these environment variables are defined:

* `http_proxy="http://10.0.2.2:3128"`
* `https_proxy="http://10.0.2.2:3128"`
* `HTTP_PROXY="http://10.0.2.2:3128"`
* `HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.0.2.2:3128"`
* `no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,.local`

## Troubleshooting

Check proxy function in the App Build Environment:

```code
    wget http://www.boschrexroth.com
```

If no error occurs the internet access via the proxy server is working. In this case remove the downloaded file.

```code
    rm index.html*
```

Check the following points if there are problems with Px:

* Are the proxy settings Proxy Settings in the App Build Environment fitting to the px.ini file on the host?
* For more informations about the settings in px.in see [px.ini on github](https://github.com/genotrance/px/blob/master/px.ini)
* Host PC: Is another proxy running e.g. cntlm?
* Host PC: Enable logging with parameter log = 1 in px.ini
