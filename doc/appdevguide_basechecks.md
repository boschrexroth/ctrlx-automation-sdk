# 1. snapcraft.yaml

## 1.1 Checked content

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **title** | is unique and length is between 3 and 40  characters |
| **name**  | matches with the snap name (technical app name) |
| **version** | follows semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and does not exceed 32 characters |
| **description** | provides a short description of the App and is at least 16 characters long |
| **degree of isolation** | is set to `confinement = "strict"` |
| **grade** | is set to `grade = "stable"` |
| **restart delay** | ist set to `5` or higher |
| **plugs** | list of interfaces consumed by the snap |
| **slots** | list of interfaces provided by the snap (optional)|

| **package-certificates** | certificates and keys of the snap (optional) |

## 1.2 Additional notes

- **Schema for snapcraft.yaml:** <https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/schema/snapcraft.json>
- **Schema for technical app  name:** "ctrlx-{company name}-{app name}-{app version}_arm64/amd64.snap"
- **ctrlX Device Portal: App name in Private Repository:** If the App is provided in a Private Repository for the ctrlX Device Portal, the Name in the Artifact Description in the Repository should be identical to the Name in snapcraft.yaml. Please see <https://docs.automation.boschrexroth.com/doc/2056862327/ctrlx-device-portal/latest/en/> for additional information about the ctrlX Device Portal and the Private Repository.

# 2. package-manifest.json

## 2.1 Checked content

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **licenses** | list of all used licenses (`licenses.name, .title, .description .required`) |
| **certificatestores** | snap service to handle keys and certificates (optional) |
| **menus** | optional: entries for sidebar integration (if use, the entries must be unique) |

For each given Proxy Mapping `services.proxyMapping[i]`:

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **name** | is only lowercase, contains `.web` and is unique in the list |
| **url** | is only lowercase and starts with `/` |
| **binding** | is valid / not empty |

## 2.3 Additional notes

- the *package-manifest.json* file must provide service entries for all services which are used in in the *portlist-description.json* file (proxy.service-name, see 3.)
- the *package-manifest.json* file must provide service entries for all services which are used in in the *unixsocket-description.json* file (socket name and accessibility, see 4.)

# 3. portlist-description.json

## 3.3 Checked content

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **id** | is available and matches to the technical app name (see also **name** entry in *snapcraft.yaml*) |

For each given port in the description (`ports[i]`):

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **number**|  has 3 to 5 digits and exists only once in the list|
| **purpose**| has at least 16 characters|
| **application-protocol**| has at least 3 characters|
| **binding**| (Network Binding Interface) is either localhost or IP|
| **routing** |is either internal or external|
| **service-name** |starts with `ctrlx-` or `bosch-`, is lowercase and exists only once in the list|
| **default-state**| is either `open` or `closed`|

## 3.4 Additional Notes

- **Number of open ports**: For security reasons, the number of open ports should be limited to 3
- **Unwanted direct external access**: The following configuration should be avoided:
  - `"protocol = HTTP or HTTPS"`, `"binding = IP"` and `"routing = external"`

- **Wrong configuration**: these configurations are considered as mismatch:
  - `"protocol not HTTP or HTTPS"`, `"binding = IP"` and `"routing = internal"`
  - `"protocol not HTTP or HTTPS"`, `"binding = localhost"` and `"routing = external"`

- **Port conflicts with reserved ports**:
  - Ports that are listed in the [Reserved interfaces and ports](appdevguide_reserved-interfaces.md) will generate a vakidation error

For each given socket `(sockets[i])`

| **Item** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **name** |is only lowercase, end with `.sock` or `.socket` and exists only once in the list|
