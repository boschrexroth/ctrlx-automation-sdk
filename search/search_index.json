This can give  translators additional information,  that may be relevant for translation. \nFor example, types in the ctrlX CORE are:\n    * title  (page / dialog titles)\n    * header (column headers etc.)\n    * tab (tab page titles)\n    * menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * sub menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * button (button text)\n    * tooltip (tooltip text)\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Localization file formats\nTwo formats of localization files are supported:\n- the flat format\n- the namespaced format\n\nEach of them has its pros and cons.\n\n**Flat format**\n\nIn flat format each key/value pair corresponds to one line within the json file.\n\nThe flat format is the straight forward approach that can be used especially in small webapps/weblibs that do not have much translatable text.\nThis is quite simple. However, with increasing file length it becomes difficult to keep the overview about the file content.\n\nLocalization file in flat format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage.element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n}\n````\n**Namespaced format**\n\nTo add structure to extensive localization files the namespaced format can be used.\n\nIn this format the effective key (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage.element1\"*) will be composed of the namespace (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage\"*) and the key within the namespace (e.g. *\"element1\"*).\nThis means that both formats are equivalent and represent the same localization information.\n\nLocalization file in namespaced format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage\": {\n    \"element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n    \"element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n    \"element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note: Comments and remarks are not supported in localization files</p>"},{"location":"localizaction.html#3-best-practice-how-to-make-an-app-localizable","title":"3 Best practice: How to make an app localizable","text":"<p>Note:</p> <p>This chapter describes a ctrlX CORE best practice to add localization to an app. Bosch Rexroth does not guarantee that this practice will work for Partner Apps.</p> <p>Please see http://www.ngx-translate.com/ for additional information.

This is probably the simplest signing method to use since any <code>[]byte</code> can be used as a valid secret. They are also slightly computationally faster to use, though this rarely is enough to matter. Symmetric signing methods work the best when both producers and consumers of tokens are trusted, or even the same system. Since the same secret is used to both sign and validate tokens, you can't easily distribute the key for validation.</p> <p>Asymmetric signing methods, such as RSA, use different keys for signing and verifying tokens.
