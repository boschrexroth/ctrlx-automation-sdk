This can give  translators additional information,  that may be relevant for translation. \nFor example, types in ctrlX OS are:\n    * title  (page / dialog titles)\n    * header (column headers etc.)\n    * tab (tab page titles)\n    * menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * sub menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * button (button text)\n    * tooltip (tooltip text)\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Localization file formats\nTwo formats of localization files are supported:\n- the flat format\n- the namespaced format\n\nEach of them has its pros and cons.\n\n**Flat format**\n\nIn flat format each key/value pair corresponds to one line within the json file.\n\nThe flat format is the straight forward approach that can be used especially in small webapps/weblibs that do not have much translatable text.\nThis is quite simple. However, with increasing file length it becomes difficult to keep the overview about the file content.\n\nLocalization file in flat format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage.element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n}\n````\n**Namespaced format**\n\nTo add structure to extensive localization files the namespaced format can be used.\n\nIn this format the effective key (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage.element1\"*) will be composed of the namespace (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage\"*) and the key within the namespace (e.g. *\"element1\"*).\nThis means that both formats are equivalent and represent the same localization information.\n\nLocalization file in namespaced format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage\": {\n    \"element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n    \"element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n    \"element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note: Comments and remarks are not supported in localization files</p>"},{"location":"localizaction.html#3-best-practice-how-to-make-an-app-localizable","title":"3 Best practice: How to make an app localizable","text":"<p>Note:</p> <p>This chapter describes a ctrlX OS best practice to add localization to an app. Bosch Rexroth does not guarantee that this practice will work for Partner Apps.</p> <p>Please see http://www.ngx-translate.com/ for additional information.

Most web server frameworks already support this functionality. The benefit of Unix sockets is the additional security (file access can be restricted via file permissions) and the lower attack surface on network level (the service cannot be reached externally). To enable your snap and to provide the reverse proxy access to your Unix socket, use the content interface slot \"package-run\".

The file has to be managed completely by your application logic and - in contrast to a network socket, has to be deleted after unbinding. Also consider deleting the Unix domain socket before binding your web server before start-up.</p> <p>Now, publish the information on the socket file using the package-manifest via the ProxyMapping described above.

If required, shorten the path by replacing \"package-run\" with \"run\" and change the file name from \"third-party-snap.web.sock\" to \"web.sock\".

These files (or directories) have to be ignored on loading and when saving the appdata to an archived configuration.</p> <p>An app can specify such files using the \"appPrivateFiles\" element in the configuration section of its manifest. The element value is an array of strings where each string represents a regular expression following the RE2 syntax (https://golang.org/s/re2syntax). The expressions describe paths and names of files to be considered as private and are checked case-insensitively.</p> <p>The following example shows the declaration of \"appPrivateFiles\" with 3 regular expressions and the declaration of the app's root directory:</p> <p>package-manifest.json</p> <pre><code>\"configuration\": {\n  \"appPrivateFiles\": [\n    \"^my-app/private/\",\n    \"^my-app/mixed/[^/]+\\\\.bak\",\n    \"^my-app/mixed/$\"\n  ],\n  \"appDirectories\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"my-app\",\n      \"description\": \"My app\",\n      \"icon\": \"bosch-ic-components\",\n      \"copyOnLoad\": true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Apps should only specify private files in their own app directories. Therefore, it is a good practice to start each regular expression with \"^my-app/\" where my-app is a root app directory of the app.</p> <p>Hints for the regular expressions: The characters \"[]().\\^\\$|?*+{}\" have special meanings and must be escaped with \"\\\" to be used uninterpreted. \"^\" matches the start of the string, \"$\" matches the end of the string. To provide \"\\\\\" in the manifest file which is in JSON format, you have to double it because the backslash is an escape character in JSON too.</p> <p>Examples for regular expressions (with an app root directory of \"my-app\")</p> Regular expression Meaning \"^my-app/private/\" defines the my-app/private directory and its content as private \"<sup>my-app/mixed/[</sup>/]+..bak\" defines all files with extension .bak within the my-app/mixed directory as private \"^my-app/mixed/$\" defines the my-app/mixed directory itself as private so that it is not removed if empty"},{"location":"persistdata.html#accessing-configuration-files-per-webdav","title":"Accessing configuration files per WebDAV","text":"<p>The configuration files are available via WebDAV protocol under the ctrlx-device web address with base path of \"solutions/webdav\", eg. access the configuration.json file content of appdata:</p> <pre><code>https://localhost:8443/solutions/webdav/appdata/configuration.json\n</code></pre> <p>See also: golang WebDAV client and nodejs WebDAV client</p>"},{"location":"persistdata.html#accessing-configuration-files-with-winscp","title":"Accessing configuration files with WinSCP","text":"<p>WinSCP is a windows app, which allows access to a remote file system via WebDAV.</p>"},{"location":"persistdata.html#connect-to-a-ctrlx-core","title":"Connect to a ctrlX CORE","text":"<p>Start WinSCP, login with:</p> <pre><code>File protocol:          WebDAV\nHost name:              IP-address or hostname of the ctrlX CORE\nPort number:            443 or 8443 for a ctrlX CORE&lt;sup&gt;virtual&lt;/sup&gt;\nUser name and Password: credentials on the ctrlX CORE\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The user needs manage configuration rights to access the files.</p> <p>Access the configuration files located in /solutions/webdav</p> <p></p> <p>The folder \"appdata\" contains the files of the active configuration.

This is probably the simplest signing method to use since any <code>[]byte</code> can be used as a valid secret. They are also slightly computationally faster to use, though this rarely is enough to matter. Symmetric signing methods work the best when both producers and consumers of tokens are trusted, or even the same system. Since the same secret is used to both sign and validate tokens, you can't easily distribute the key for validation.</p> <p>Asymmetric signing methods, such as RSA, use different keys for signing and verifying tokens.
