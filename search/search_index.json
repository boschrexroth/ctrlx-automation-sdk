Although it is quite unprobable, that a malicious actor could replace ctrlX OS' license manager, a further layer of security is added - Applications can request licenses (see License Manager API) and set the 'signResponse' query parameter - Once a license has been requested (with the corresponding query parameter set) the response's header will contain a signature - This signature was calculated using the device certificate (and the corresponding tpm-based key) and can be used to fully verify that the license response was indeed from a certified ctrlX OS device with no spoofed license manager</p> <p>Usage: 1) Any application that wants to use this mechanism will need to send a license request with the corresponding query parameter set      1.1) The response header contains a hex-encoded signature (\"Payload-Signature\")      2.2) The signature is created using ECDSA-SHA256 on the standardized curve 'SECP-256'  2) Once the response (and the signature in 'Payload-Signature') the application needs to verify that the signature is indeed valid and was produced by the device  2.1) The license manager's device certificate chain (and the public key herein) can be used for this - see (see License Manager API)  2.2) Use the public key inside the end-entity (device) certificate to verify the signature  3) Once signature verification is successful, we can assume that the chain sent by the device and the key used for signing correspond, however additional steps are required to ensure that the device is indeed a ctrlX OS device (and the license manager is unspoofed)  3.1) The device-certificate chain as retrieved in step 2.1 can now be used to check whether the device is a ctrlX OS device by verifying the certificate chain  3.2) The application now needs to verify that the certificate was indeed signed by an authorized ctrlX OS party (and its root CA certificate)  3.3) For this purpose it needs to know the corresponding ctrlX root CA certificate (com.ctrlx-automation.os.crt) - recommendation is to have it inside the app's binaries as this will ensure that no malicious entity would be able to change it.  3.4) Verify the certificate chain from the device up to the mentioned root certificate </p> <p>Note: As there are multiple steps involved here (where some of them might be time consuming due to cryptographic complexity) it is the app's responsibility whether it wants to check this once during startup, according to a defined interval, etc. Please note the genereal perception is that - if this feature is required - checking it during startup suffices to verify the integrity of the license manager.</p> <p>ctrlX OS root CA certificate: As stated in in step 3.2, the application needs to know the ctrlX OS root CA certificate (com.ctrlx-automation.os.crt). If this feature is required, the corresponding certificate needs to be embedded inside the application.

This can give  translators additional information,  that may be relevant for translation. \nFor example, types in ctrlX OS are:\n    * title  (page / dialog titles)\n    * header (column headers etc.)\n    * tab (tab page titles)\n    * menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * sub menu (sidebar menus and other menus)\n    * button (button text)\n    * tooltip (tooltip text)\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Localization file formats\nTwo formats of localization files are supported:\n- the flat format\n- the namespaced format\n\nEach of them has its pros and cons.\n\n**Flat format**\n\nIn flat format each key/value pair corresponds to one line within the json file.\n\nThe flat format is the straight forward approach that can be used especially in small webapps/weblibs that do not have much translatable text.\nThis is quite simple. However, with increasing file length it becomes difficult to keep the overview about the file content.\n\nLocalization file in flat format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage.element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n  \"myapp.startPage.element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n}\n````\n**Namespaced format**\n\nTo add structure to extensive localization files the namespaced format can be used.\n\nIn this format the effective key (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage.element1\"*) will be composed of the namespace (e.g. *\"myapp.startPage\"*) and the key within the namespace (e.g. *\"element1\"*).\nThis means that both formats are equivalent and represent the same localization information.\n\nLocalization file in namespaced format:\n```json\n{\n  \"myapp.startPage\": {\n    \"element1\": \"Localized Text 1\",\n    \"element2\": \"Localized Text 2\",\n    \"element3\": \"Localized Text 3\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Note: Comments and remarks are not supported in localization files</p>"},{"location":"localizaction.html#3-best-practice-how-to-make-an-app-localizable","title":"3 Best practice: How to make an app localizable","text":"<p>Note:</p> <p>This chapter describes a ctrlX OS best practice to add localization to an app. Bosch Rexroth does not guarantee that this practice will work for Partner Apps.</p> <p>Please see http://www.ngx-translate.com/ for additional information.

Most web server frameworks already support this functionality. The benefit of Unix sockets is the additional security (file access can be restricted via file permissions) and the lower attack surface on network level (the service cannot be reached externally). To enable your snap and to provide the reverse proxy access to your Unix socket, use the content interface slot \"package-run\". It uses the same mechanism as the \"package-assets\" interface.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>[...]\n  package-run:\n    interface: content\n    content: package-run\n    source:\n      write:\n      - $SNAP_DATA/package-run/${SNAPCRAFT_PROJECT_NAME}\n</code></pre> <p>In the example mentioned above, your \"unix socket file\" should be created under <code>{$SNAP_DATA}/package-run/{$SNAP_NAME}/web.sock</code>. The file has to be managed completely by your application logic and - in contrast to a network socket, has to be deleted after unbinding. Also consider deleting the Unix domain socket before binding your web server before start-up.</p> <p>Now, publish the information on the socket file using the package-manifest via the ProxyMapping described above. The relevant part is the \"binding\" section below. Replace</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>The path length of a Unix socket is limited to 108 characters. Thus, ensure that the resolved path, e.g /var/snap/third-party-snap/current/package-run/third-party-snap/third-party-snap.web.sock does not exceed that limit and that the highlighted part does not exceed 50 characters. If required, shorten the path by replacing \"package-run\" with \"run\" and change the file name from \"third-party-snap.web.sock\" to \"web.sock\".

Therefore, it is a good practice to start each regular expression with \"^my-app/\" where my-app is a root app directory of the app.</p> <p>Hints for the regular expressions: The characters \"[]().\\^\\$|?*+{}\" have special meanings and must be escaped with \"\\\" to be used uninterpreted. \"^\" matches the start of the string, \"$\" matches the end of the string. To provide \"\\\\\" in the manifest file which is in JSON format, you have to double it because the backslash is an escape character in JSON too.</p> <p>Examples for regular expressions (with an app root directory of \"my-app\")</p> Regular expression Meaning \"^my-app/private/\" defines the my-app/private directory and its content as private \"<sup>my-app/mixed/[</sup>/]+..bak\" defines all files with extension .bak within the my-app/mixed directory as private \"^my-app/mixed/$\" defines the my-app/mixed directory itself as private so that it is not removed if empty"},{"location":"persistdata.html#accessing-configuration-files-per-webdav","title":"Accessing configuration files per WebDAV","text":"<p>The configuration files are available via WebDAV protocol under the ctrlx-device web address with base path of \"solutions/webdav\", eg. access the configuration.json file content of appdata:</p> <pre><code>https://localhost:8443/solutions/webdav/appdata/configuration.json\n</code></pre> <p>See also: golang WebDAV client and nodejs WebDAV client</p>"},{"location":"persistdata.html#accessing-configuration-files-with-winscp","title":"Accessing configuration files with WinSCP","text":"<p>WinSCP is a windows app, which allows access to a remote file system via WebDAV.</p>"},{"location":"persistdata.html#connect-to-a-ctrlx-core","title":"Connect to a ctrlX CORE","text":"<p>Start WinSCP, login with:</p> <pre><code>File protocol:          WebDAV\nHost name:              IP-address or hostname of the ctrlX CORE\nPort number:            443 or 8443 for a ctrlX CORE&lt;sup&gt;virtual&lt;/sup&gt;\nUser name and Password: credentials on the ctrlX CORE\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The user needs manage configuration rights to access the files.</p> <p>Access the configuration files located in /solutions/webdav</p> <p></p> <p>The folder \"appdata\" contains the files of the active configuration.
