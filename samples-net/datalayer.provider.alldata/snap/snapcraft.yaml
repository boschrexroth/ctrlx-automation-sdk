summary: ctrlX Data Layer provider all data sample written in .NET for ctrlX OS.
description: |
  The sample demonstrates how to provide all available data types to the ctrlX Data Layer.
  The demo creates a 'static' and a 'dynamic' folder under the root node 'samples'.
  The 'static' folder provides nodes with constant values.
  In the 'dynamic' folder the same nodes are provided as in 'static' folder but with changing value every second.
grade: stable # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
confinement: strict # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots
